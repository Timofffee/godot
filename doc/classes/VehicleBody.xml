	<brief_description>
		Physics body that simulates the behaviour of a car.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node implements all the physical logic needed to model the car. It is based on the vehicle's raycast system commonly found in physics engines. You will need to add [CollisionShape] to the main body of your car and add [VehicleWheel] nodes to the wheels. You should also add [MeshInstance] to this node for your car's 3D model, but this model should not include wheel meshes. You should control the vehicle by using the [member VehicleWheel.brake], [member VehicleWheel.engine_force], and [member VehicleWheel.steering] properties and not change the position or orientation of this node directly.
		Note that by default the starting point of your body will determine the center of mass of your car. To use a custom mass center, use the [member center_of_mass] parameter.

			User center of mass of the vehicle. You can use the [Spatial] node or any other node inherited from [Spatial]. It is best to use the node [Position3D], as it visually displays the position of the node. Be sure to make the node a descendant of the current node. 
			If the parameter is not set, the default starting point of your body will determine the center of mass of your car and this can lead to incorrect operation of the car.
			The best option for setting the center of mass point is at an equal distance from the wheels and slightly above the wheels in height.
